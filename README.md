# OSPO License scan action

A GitHub Action created by the Alliander Open Source Program Office (OSPO) to scan for licenses in your code.

At the moment this Action is intended to cover the use-cases at Alliander, so it might not fit your use-cases.
Feel free to fork it and modify it to your needs.

Currently this Action revolves around the [OSS Review Toolkit (ORT) project](https://oss-review-toolkit.org/), but this might change in the future.
If that were to change, it makes sense to branch off the ORT part of this Action into a separate Action.
